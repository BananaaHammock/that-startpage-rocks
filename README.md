A simple and quick startpage that lets you access your favourite websites as well as the most famous services, all that with just a click or a few keywords. It's a good replacement to the default startpage on your browser.

## How it works

Just login on our website with either facebook or google. Then follow the setup guide, a link to your startpage will be generated. Then set this link as your startpage (this process depends on your browser). You can use that link on any browser, just login to access that startpage.

## Features

Compared to other startpages available on the web, _That Startpage Rocks_ is focused on simplicity and productivity. Our aim is that you spend the least time finding what you want, no distractions are there to slow you down, just powerful tools to help you quickly find the right content. This does not affect the beauty of your startpage, however, thanks to our modern interface and the ability to customize your startpage with your own background image.
_In a few words: Simplicity, Speed, Productivity, Beauty, Delight_

#### Add your favourite websites

Like you would expect, add your favourite websites to your startpage. Thanks to our [[scalable]](http://startpage-1072.appspot.com/icons) icon repository, your apps have beautifully sharp icons.

#### Search famous websites

The very special search engine lets you quickly find content from major web services. It works a little bit like a command line. For instance, if you'd like to search a youtube video, just type `youtube` followed by a query. You'll then get realtime results, linking directly to videos.

_Here are all the supported web services :_

- youtube
- spotify
- soundcloud
- pixabay
- wikipedia
- guardian
- new york times

#### Customize your startpage

Change your startpage's title, colour theme, and background image, with the editor.
